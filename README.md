# Crossmodal and Decentralized Agents supported by Unified Pipelines

### How to Use This Table

1. **Decentralized + Crossmodal Synergy**  
   Each **FMOps dimension** highlights ways to integrate **agents** spanning various data modalities (text, image, audio, etc.) while maintaining a **decentralized** control mechanism for resilience and trustworthiness.

2. **Blockchain as the Backbone**  
   By storing critical metadata, checkpoints, and agent interactions on a **blockchain**, the system benefits from **immutability**, **distributed governance**, and **transparent traceability**.

3. **Unified Pipeline Orchestration**  
   Smart contracts (or similar on-chain logic) can govern **agent orchestration**, automatically activating and rewarding the agents best suited to each incoming task, leading to a robust and **scalable** architecture.

Feel free to adapt or refine these points based on your organizationâ€™s specific goals and constraints.
